### Project Description
Kashandii Analyzer is a fun web app that scans your photo or live webcam feed to predict your ‚Äúkashandiness‚Äù (baldness level). It calculates hair density, estimates years until baldness, roasts you for fun, and stores your results on a public leaderboard.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People walk around without knowing if their hair is plotting a quiet escape. They miss early warning signs and never prepare for the incoming glare.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An AI-powered (well‚Ä¶ heuristic-powered) baldness predictor that not only calculates your hair‚Äôs survival chances but also roasts you mercilessly, for entertainment and public records.
